### Cracking the Code of Entrepreneurship

+ The tools we use in entrepreneurship are still pretty basic
  - ONE TOOL => Business Plan | BURN Business Plan because waste of time
  - "Plans are worthless but the planning is important"
  - **Plan your search** For the business model - once found THEN execute - shift
  - software supported tools to help us with our thinking...

1. CONCEPT
  + What is a business model?  As many answers as people in the room.
  + "Bla bla bla" phenomenon - words are not enough for business models
  + map them out - then ideas become clear
  + shared language for the construction and language of business models
  + "The Business Model Ontology" - PHD | Write a business best-seller : "Business Model Generation"
  + ***Business Model Canvas*** | 9 Building Blocks : You want to map them out on a single canvas
    1. **Customer Segments**
      * All the people/organizations creating value
	2. **Value Propositions**
	  * For each segment you have a value proposition
	  * bundles of projects and services that create value for your customers
	3. **Channels**
	  * touch points for customers where you deliver value 
	4. **Customer Relationships**
	  * The type of relationship you are establishing with your customers 
	5. **Revenue Streams**
	  * Make clear how and through which processes capturing value 
	6. **Key Resources**
	  * Which assets are indespinsable in your business
	7. **Key Activities**
	  * Which things you really need in order to perform well
	8. **Key Partnerships**
	  * Who can help you leverage your business
	9. **Cost Structure**
	  * When you understand infrastructure you should understand cost structure.

  * How all pieces fit together
  * sketching it out with post-its
  * Never write on a canvas, use the post it notes
  * every building block use a post-it note. -- NOW IT IS MOBILE
  * what is the impact if I take away a variable - see relationship between pieces

Learn from a Coffee Business Model:

Q: How much did the cost of home coffee consumption
change for Swiss households over the last couple years?

Less or more over the last couple of years?
Guesses - +50%, -20%, +200%

A company in Switzerland was able to get the market to
pay 600 to 800% more over the past couple of years.

NESPRESSO is the company

At the heart of NESPRESSO is a technology: single portion coffee, with a machine, with pods
You get a solid espresso out the other end at home

RESULTS: After 2 decades still one of the fastest growing in the Nestle empire

3 billion US dollars - one product line

What are core components in their business model that made them SO successful...

Once you have their machine, you have to use their pods, once you have the technology, they no longer have to reach

Build the Nespresso STORES to solidify the idea of high end brand

key resources:
* patents key componant, margins not shut down, certain patents are running out, business model is never finished
* coffee
* brand - if you have no brand you are dead - "Expensive to create"

```
REV STREAMS: 1xmachine sales, repetitive pod sales
COST STRUCTURE: production, B2C distribution, marketing

```

Why Nespresso?  Something you can learn
Nespresso almost failed in 1987 - close to going bankrupt, same product/technology - business model didn't work
Sold to offices through sales force of machine manufacturers.  Offices not interested, salesforce didn't want to sells mall machines.
"Pivoted" to the new business model only because board said "We produced these machines warehouses are full"

Have 9 blocks and good story...

What is missing? --> NUMBERS

Without numbers "Intellectual masturbation"

throw in ballpark figures/numbers

business model prototype

```
CSeg: entreprenuers, consumers
Channels: App Store
Value Prop: Business Model App
Revenue Streams: App Sales

revenue stream in app store = sales - cut in 30%
How many customers could reach first year? 15%

How much to pay? 29 dollars

How much to apple -> 20%

The development of the app is more expensive than what could earn.

FIX IT:

Now Web App
Only sell to consultants - customers only want once, consultants are selling product on a constant basis
channel is web
recurring rate/subscription
Market share 15% 9 dollars per month WAY more interesting

```

Several different alternatives and variables in one sitting.

"prototyping is the conversation you have with your ideas"


PROCESS:
Come up with alternatives
Even the best business model on paper is only a set of hypotheses and guesses

Business Model Canvas - Design Thinking - Prototyping

You can really test business model and test ideas before you build them.
